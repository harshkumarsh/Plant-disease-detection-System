PLANT DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM

Overview:
---------
This Plant Disease Detection System is designed to help farmers and gardeners detect diseases in plants at an early stage. The system uses image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and classify plant diseases from images of plant leaves.

Features:
---------
- Disease Detection: Identifies and classifies various plant diseases from leaf images.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use interface for uploading leaf images and viewing results.
- Detailed Reports: Provides detailed information about the detected disease and possible treatments.
- High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for high accuracy.

Technologies Used:
------------------
- OpenCV: For image processing.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training machine learning models.
- Python: Core programming language for implementing the system.
- Flask/Django: For creating the web interface.
